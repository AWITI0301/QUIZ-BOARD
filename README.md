# <QUIZ WEBSITE>

## Description

- I was motivated by Moringa school to create a questions website.
- The website was built to help test the students if they understood the content on Javascript that they learnt at school. This will be done through test questions.
- This website helps to solve the problem of testing if the students understood the concept of Javascript through giving out questions to the students and getting the answers immediately after the submission.
- I learnt that creating the website requires alot of time and being keen when doing the coding.
